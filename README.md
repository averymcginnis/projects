# Projects
A collection of things I have built over the years! Project code is included above with the same file name as the project title.

## Blinky Ring Thing
Fun handheld game with the goal of stopping the rotating light at the top of the ring. PCB designed using Autodesk Eagle and ordered from JLCPCB. Logic is powered by Arduino.
